										<h3>About me</h3>
										<p style="color:#000000;"> Currently, I am reading DPhil in Health Data Science at Keble College, the University of Oxford after graduated with a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Manchester in 2019, specialising in both statistical machine learning and numerical linear algebra. I worked on the statistical interpretation of advanced machine learning methods in my bachelor thesis, and I also completed another project to analyse the convergence properties and sensitivity of the PageRank algorithm. During my undergraduate studies, I undertook internships in data analysis and machine learning, where I built an automatic warning system for abnormal user data detection. My main research interests are statistical inference and modelling for neuroimaging analyses, with particular regard to fMRI data. Outside of studies, I enjoy reading, baking and travelling.</p>

										<h3 >The PageRank Algorithm Project</h3>
										<p>I am currently undertaking the final year project regarding the PageRank Algorithm (under the supervision of Prof. Tisseur), which is used by Google Search to rank websites by measuring the importance. The PageRank Algorithm is based on webgraph, formed by all pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges. A hyperlink to a page is treated as a vote.</p>	
										<p>My research emphasises on the simple sensitivity measure of the PageRank vector’s derivative, and further explores the properties of its higher derivatives. Also, the convergence properties of several iterative methods in computing PageRank scores are researched extensively, and selected Wikipedia pages are ranked according to their calculated PageRank value. Python is used to simulate the PageRank Algorithm in my research, while Mathematica is also involved to crawled the Wikipedia web structure and accelerate the symbolic computation.</p>

									<h3>Stock trader project</h3>
									<p style="color:#000000;">It is a python module for virtual stock trading, involving the ARIMA model to predict the future stock trend based on previous prices (However, due to the difficulty in identifying the parameters, the prediciton isn't ideal for all situations and needs further improvement).</p>
									<p style="color:#000000;">The stock trader module is designed to: 
									<ol>
									<li style="color:#000000;">allow the user to load historical financial data 
                                    and to simulate the buying and selling of shares on the stock market.</li>
									<li style="color:#000000;">allow user to load the data of portfolio, 
                                    and evaluate the portfolio on the chosen day.</li>
                                    <li style="color:#000000;">The two trading strategies go through all provided trading days, buy and sell shares automatically, based on specific rules.</li>

								<p style="color:#000000;"> I believe that "What we know is very slight, what we don’t know is immense. Man follows only phantoms"，and I am always ready to accept new knowledge and be involved in lifelong learning. I enjoy travelling, especially blending into local culture, and I have been to more than 10 countries.
