										<h3>About me</h3>
										<p style="color:#000000;"> I am currently a third year mathematics student at the University of Manchester. I obtained Mathematics Excellence Scholarship for 2016-2017, and ranked #2 (340 students in total). My research interests are in the area of Numerical linear algebra and Statistical learning.</p>
										<p style="color:#000000;"> I worked for Caitong securities as a database intern during the summer of 2018. Before then, I once worked as a data analysis intern at Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co, a software company providing updated stock information and stock trading platform. </p>

										<h3 >The PageRank Algorithm Project</h3>
										<p>I am currently undertaking the final year project regarding the PageRank Algorithm (under the supervision of Prof. Tisseur), which is used by Google Search to rank websites by measuring the importance. The PageRank Algorithm is based on webgraph, formed by all pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges. A hyperlink to a page is treated as a vote.</p>	
										<p>My research emphasises on the simple sensitivity measure of the PageRank vector’s derivative, and further explores the properties of its higher derivatives. Also, the convergence properties of several iterative methods in computing PageRank scores are researched extensively, and selected Wikipedia pages are ranked according to their calculated PageRank value. Python is used to simulate the PageRank Algorithm in my research, while Mathematica is also involved to crawled the Wikipedia web structure and accelerate the symbolic computation.</p>

									<h3>Exploring The Interface Between Statistics And Machine Learning</h3>
									<p style="color:#000000;">I plan to undertake another final year project related to Machine learning next semester, under the supervision of Prof Strimmer. 
									</p>	
									<p style="color:#000000;">My research will focus on Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network, with the identification results of successive models(AlexNet, BN-Inception-v2, Inception-v3)compared. </p>

									<h3>Stock trader project</h3>
									<p>It is a python module for virtual stock trading, involving the ARIMA model to predict the future stock trend based on previous prices (However, due to the difficulty in identifying the parameters, the prediciton isn't ideal for all situations and needs further improvement).</p>
									<p>The stock trader module is designed to: 
									<ol>
									<li>allow the user to load historical financial data 
                                    and to simulate the buying and selling of shares on the stock market.</li>
									<li>allow user to load the data of portfolio, 
                                    and evaluate the portfolio on the chosen day.</li>
                                    <li>The two trading strategies go through all provided trading days, buy and sell shares automatically, based on specific rules.</li>

								<p style="color:#000000;"> I believe that "What we know is very slight, what we don’t know is immense. Man follows only phantoms"，and I am always ready to accept new knowledge and be involved in lifelong learning. I enjoy travelling, especially blending into local culture, and I have been to more than 10 countries.
